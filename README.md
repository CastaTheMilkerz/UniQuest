# UniQuest Prg

This is a **C** program that generates a random number from a user-specified range of integers. It uses dynamic memory allocation to create an array of integers that represent the range, and then randomly selects and removes one of those integers until the range is exhausted.
I use that for listed quest for speech exam.

## Gettin Started

To run this program, you will need a C compiler such as GCC. You can compile the program from the command line using the following command in the directory where you have cloned the repository:
 
  `gcc -o  sel_quest sel_quest.c`

Then, you can run the program by typing:

`./sel_quest`

## Usage 

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the lower and upper bounds of the range from which you want to generate random numbers. After you enter the bounds, the program will wait for you to press Enter. When you press Enter, the program will generate a random number from the range and print it to the screen. It will then remove that number from the range and prompt you to press Enter again to generate the next random number. This process will continue until the entire range has been exhausted.
